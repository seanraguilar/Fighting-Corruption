# Fighting-Corruption

In general, corruption is bad. In many cases, it makes sense to make fighting corruption one of the main pre-requisites for getting financial help: we do not want this money to line the pockets of corrupted officials, we want to help the people. In this paper, we argue, however, that in some cases -- of over-regulated and/or oppressive regimes -- too much emphasis on fighting corruption may be counter-productive: instead of helping people, it may hurt them.
